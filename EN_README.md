# 🎧 AE Beat Marker — Automatic Beat Markers for After Effects

> A fast, lightweight, and free solution for automatically placing markers on audio peaks (beats) directly in After Effects.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ⚡ Automatically adds markers to a composition based on audio peaks  
- 🔧 Adjustable sensitivity threshold and minimum interval between beats  
- 🧠 Uses values from `Audio Amplitude` → `Both Channels`  
- 🪄 No external libraries, licenses, or dependencies required  
- ✅ Compatible with AE 2024+ (works even on cracked versions)

---

## 📦 Installation

1. Download the [`beatMarker.jsx`](./beatMarker.jsx) file  
2. In After Effects, go to `File > Scripts > Run Script File…`  
3. Select the composition that includes an `Audio Amplitude` layer  
4. Run the script — markers will appear automatically!

💡 **Pro tip:** For easier access, place the script in the `Scripts` or `ScriptUI Panels` folder.

## 📝 Notes

- This script is designed to work out of the box without any additional setup.
- Works best with preprocessed audio where beats are clearly visible.
- Ideal for editors, motion designers, and VFX artists who want quick sync.
